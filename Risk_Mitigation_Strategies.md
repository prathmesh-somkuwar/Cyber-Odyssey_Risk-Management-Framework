## High Priority Risk Controls

| Risk | Technical Controls | Administrative Controls | Physical Controls | CISSP Domain |
|------|--------------------|------------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Ransomware | EDR, encryption, immutable backups | Incident response plan | Secure data center | Security Operations, Asset Security |
| DDoS | WAF, AWS Shield, auto-scaling | DDoS procedures | N/A | Network Security |
| Phishing | Email filtering, training platform | Security awareness program | Laptop encryption | Security & Risk Management |
